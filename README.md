# Coding Interview Preparation

This repository contains solutions and reference materials for various coding interview problems. Each problem is documented in its own Markdown file, providing a quick reference to the problem description, solution, and implementation details.

## Problems Solved

1. [LRU Cache](lru_cache_reference.md)  
   A data structure that implements the Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with O(1) operations for `get` and `put` methods.

2. [Trapping Rain Water](trapping_rain_water.md)  
   An algorithm to calculate how much water can be trapped between elevation bars after raining.

3. [Number of Islands](number_of_islands.md)  
   A solution to count the number of islands in a 2D grid using DFS and BFS approaches.

4. [Group Anagrams](group_anagrams.md)  
   A method to group words that are anagrams of each other using sorting or character count.

5. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](longest_substring_no_repeats.md)  
   An algorithm to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters using the sliding window technique.

6. [Course Schedule](course_schedule.md)
   A graph-based solution to determine if all courses can be completed given prerequisite dependencies.

7. [Word Ladder](word_ladder.md)  
   A solution to find the shortest transformation sequence between words using BFS and Bidirectional BFS.

8. [Merge k Sorted Lists](merge_k_sorted_lists.md)  
   An efficient method to merge multiple sorted linked lists using a Min-Heap or Divide-and-Conquer approach.

9. [Maximum Subarray](maximum_subarray.md)  
   A solution to find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum using Kadane's Algorithm and Divide and Conquer.
